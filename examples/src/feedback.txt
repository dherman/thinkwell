## Product Quality
The build quality is exceptional. I've been using this for six months and it still
looks brand new. The materials feel premium and durable.

## Customer Service
Unfortunately, my experience with support was frustrating. I waited 45 minutes on
hold, and the representative seemed confused about the return policy. Very disappointing.

## Value for Money
At this price point, I expected more. The features are good but competitors offer
similar products for less. Hard to recommend at full price.

## Overall Experience
Despite the support issues, I do enjoy using the product daily. The design is
intuitive and it solved the problem I bought it for.
