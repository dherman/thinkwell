TypeScript 5.0 introduced a major new feature called decorators, which are now
part of the ECMAScript standard. Decorators provide a way to add metadata and
modify class declarations, methods, properties, and parameters. They use the
@ syntax and can be used for logging, validation, dependency injection, and more.

Another key feature in TypeScript 5.0 is const type parameters, which allow
generic functions to infer more precise literal types. This reduces the need
for "as const" assertions in many cases.

The release also improved performance significantly, with faster type-checking
and reduced memory usage. The team reported up to 10-25% speed improvements
in large codebases.
