# Named Agents

The `open()` function accepts a named agent string to connect to a supported AI coding agent. Each name maps to a command that spawns the agent process via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).

## Supported Agents

| Name | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `'claude'` | `npx -y @zed-industries/claude-code-acp` | Anthropic's Claude Code CLI agent |
| `'codex'` | `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp` | OpenAI's Codex CLI agent |
| `'gemini'` | `npx -y @google/gemini-cli --experimental-acp` | Google's Gemini CLI agent |
| `'kiro'` | `kiro-cli acp` | Kiro CLI agent |
| `'opencode'` | `opencode acp` | OpenCode agent |
| `'auggie'` | `auggie --acp` | Augment Code agent |

## Usage

```typescript
import { open } from "thinkwell";

const agent = await open('claude');
```

## Custom Commands

To use an agent not in the table above, pass a `cmd` option instead of a name:

```typescript
import { open } from "thinkwell";

const agent = await open({ cmd: 'my-custom-agent --acp' });
```

## Environment Variable Overrides

You can override the agent at runtime without modifying code:

- **`$THINKWELL_AGENT`** — override with a named agent: `THINKWELL_AGENT=opencode thinkwell script.ts`
- **`$THINKWELL_AGENT_CMD`** — override with a custom command: `THINKWELL_AGENT_CMD="myagent --acp" thinkwell script.ts`

If both are set, `$THINKWELL_AGENT_CMD` takes precedence.

This is useful for:

- Running tests against different agents
- Using mock agents in CI/CD pipelines
- Switching between production and development agents

## Connection Options

Pass additional options alongside the agent name:

```typescript
import { open } from "thinkwell";

const agent = await open('claude', {
  env: {
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
    CUSTOM_VAR: "value"
  },
  timeout: 30000,
});
```
