This guide will walk you through creating your first Thinkwell agent in just a few minutes.

## Installation with Homebrew (Recommended)

Homebrew is the simplest way to install Thinkwell system-wide:
```bash
brew install dherman/thinkwell/thinkwell
```

## Zero-Install (Node.js)

If you don't want to install anything, you can use Thinkwell via `npx`:
```bash
npx -y thinkwell --help
```


## Create Your First Agent

Create a new TypeScript file called `greeting.ts`:

```typescript
import { open } from "thinkwell";

/**
 * A friendly greeting.
 * @JSONSchema
 */
export interface Greeting {
  /** The greeting message */
  message: string;
}

async function main() {
  const agent = await open('claude');
  try {
    const greeting = await agent
      .think(Greeting.Schema)
      .text("Create a friendly greeting message.")
      .run();
    console.log(greeting.message);
  } finally {
    agent.close();
  }
}
main();
```

## Run Your Script

The Thinkwell CLI can run TypeScript files directly without any compilation step:

```bash
thinkwell greeting.ts
```

You should see a friendly greeting message printed to your console.

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the key concepts:

### Imports

Thinkwell provides a standard npm package import:

- `thinkwell` - The main package, providing `open()`, `Agent`, `schemaOf`, and other APIs

### The @JSONSchema Pattern

The `@JSONSchema` JSDoc tag is central to how Thinkwell works. When you annotate an interface with `@JSONSchema`, Thinkwell automatically generates a JSON Schema and attaches it as a static `Schema` property:

```typescript
/**
 * A friendly greeting.
 * @JSONSchema
 */
export interface Greeting {
  /** The greeting message */
  message: string;
}
```

This allows you to use `Greeting.Schema` when calling `agent.think()`, which tells the agent what structured output to produce. The JSDoc comments on properties become descriptions in the generated schema, helping the AI understand what each field should contain.

### Agent Lifecycle

1. **Open** - `open('claude')` connects to the AI backend by name
2. **Think** - `agent.think(Schema).text(prompt).run()` sends your prompt and returns structured output matching your schema
3. **Close** - Always close the agent when done to clean up resources

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic agent working, explore:

- [API Overview](/api/overview) - Learn about schemas, tools, and the ThinkBuilder API
- [Sessions](/api/sessions) - Create multi-turn conversations with persistent context
