# What is Thinkwell?

Thinkwell is a TypeScript framework built to **make scripting AI agents easy**.

With Thinkwell, you can write scripts that seamlessly combine traditional programming logic with the creative problem-solving capabilities of large language models. Your code stays in control while the AI handles the parts that benefit from reasoning and natural language understanding.

## How It Works

Thinkwell uses the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com) to connect to AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and others. This means you write one script and can run it against different AI backends.

Here's a simple example:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "thinkwell:agent";
import { CLAUDE_CODE } from "thinkwell:connectors";

/** @JSONSchema */
interface Analysis {
  summary: string;
  sentiment: "positive" | "negative" | "neutral";
}

const agent = await Agent.connect(CLAUDE_CODE);

const result = await agent
  .think(Analysis.Schema)
  .text("Analyze the following customer feedback:")
  .quote(customerFeedback)
  .run();

console.log(`Sentiment: ${result.sentiment}`);
console.log(`Summary: ${result.summary}`);

agent.close();
```

## Why Thinkwell?

**Zero-config.** Run TypeScript files directly with `thinkwell script.ts`. Schemas are generated on the fly.

**Tools that just work.** Give the agent access to your functions with a simple decorator pattern. Thinkwell handles the protocol details.

**Agent-agnostic.** Write your logic once, then swap between Claude Code, Codex, or other ACP-compatible agents without changing your code.

**Type safety from end to end.** Define your expected outputs as TypeScript interfaces and get compile-time checking plus runtime validation. No more hand-crafting MCP schemas or parsing prompt results.
